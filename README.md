# Advanced Robotics Course

The materials of the advanced robotics course given at the Ofek school of gifted children. The students are normally 7th to 9th graders (ages 14 to 16), which have completed the basic robotics course. The focus of the basic course are on the hardware aspects of robotics. This course focuses on the controlling software, using machine learning and machine vision.

## Organizing of the students

   - The students will be randomly (?) divided into groups of 3 students
   - In the group, each student will have a function. One of the function is a project manager, which will keep a plan/log
   - Each group will have a name and a github repository
   - "Lessons by demand": The students will be able to order lessons for them or the whole class
   

## Plan of the course

1. Base line: brush up Python + robot control methods
   
   1.1 Python brush up
   1.2 Fun activity: customize your robot with a picture (also verify each student has a working robot)
   1.3 Learn to load sw to the robot: Make it do a rectangular with internal software
   1.4 Write virtual graphical controller, using pyGame and REPL-lib

2. Machine vision

   2.1 Draw using py-game
   2.1.1 coordinate
   2.1.2 RGB
   2.1.3 shape formulas
   2.2 encrypt pattern in BMP
   2.3 Acquire and pre-process web-cam pics (openCV)

3. Machine Learning

   3.1 (recommended) into to ML lecture
   3.2 Neural Network in 11 lines of Python
   3.3 Hands-on 1: cats/dogs ? MINST ? Leafs?
   3.4 Hands-on 2: process pics
   
4. Project

## Lesson bank

Each student group will be able to order a lecture on one of the following:

- Basic Python
- Git: how to use
- How to "talk" to the ESPx: console, serial, usb-ser, putty, ampy, web-repl
- Machine vision using Python
- Basic OpenCV
- Intro to machine learning
- Basic ML (Machine Learning). PyTorch ? SciLearn ? TensorFlow/Keras ?
- Basic vision processing using ML (CNN)
