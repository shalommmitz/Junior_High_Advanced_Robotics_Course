#A basic demo of a working ML model

## Thanks and Credit

   The code here is mostly taken from https://github.com/nicknochnack/Tensorflow-in-10-Minutes
   The code is explained by the authur at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2hzRopPbQ
   
## Install

```
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

Install TensorFlow (unless you already have CUDA): `pip install tensorflow_cpu`

## Running the code

```
. venv/bin/activate
python3 TF_in_10_mins.py
```

## The Challanges

1. Get accuracy of 85% or above (very hard)
2. Find the minimal network to get 80% accuracy
